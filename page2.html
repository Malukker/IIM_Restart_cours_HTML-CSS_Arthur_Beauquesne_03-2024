                Metalcore <br> <br>First ever released album of the band, published 2001 at Good Life Recordings then 2002 at Hopeless 
                Records. Is not considered as good as the following ones by most fans but will certainly content most Metalcore enjoyers. 
                Most of the songs are screamed. Contains a lot of religious references.

                Metalcore <br><br> Second album of the band, published 2003 at Hopeless Records. Is way more mature in its song writing, 
                featuring as much scream as plain singing. First real success of the band, peaking at 10th place in the Billboard 200 and
                getting certified platinum in the US.

                Heavy Metal <br><br> Published 2005 at Warner Records and Hopeless Records. Peaked at 30th place in Billboard 200 and 
                was certified platinum. Does not feature any screaming, as the place is given to guitar solos, riffs and more lyrical
                voices. Has much more of a Heavy Metal style, with Power Metal influences. Is considered the album that made the band
                known on an international scale.

                Heavy Metal <br><br> Eponymous album, published 2007 at Warner Records and Hopeless Records. Placed 4th in Billboard 200,
                12th in Oricon and 24 in OCC, and was certified platinum. Won the Kerrang! Album Of The Year award. Although being mostly
                Heavy Metal, its songs have lots of different styles, would it be more symphonic, country or experimental styles. That 
                abundance of styles and influences has long since become the band's signature way of writing songs. An overall extremely 
                strong album.

                Heavy Metal <br><br> Published 2010 at Warner Records. Placed 1st in Billboard 200, 5th in OCC, 12th in Oricon, was
                certified platinum, has won the Golden Gods awards for best drummer (twice), guitarists, vocalist, and album of the year.
                Started its writing normally, but changed a lot with the death of the band's drummer, Jimmy "The Rev" Sullivan, in December
                2009. The lyrics from all songs mention more or less explicitly his death and the loss it represented to the band, and the
                overall songwriting style is very grim.

                award, and the Golden Gods awards for Best guitarists and best singer. It is all about heavy metal and is very classic in
                its style, which can explain its success on an international scale. It is the most successful album they ever released,
                but also the one they consider the best out of their whole discography.

                Prog Metal <br><br> Published 2016 at Capitol Records. Placed 4th in Billboard 200 and 13 in OCC. Is themed around the 
                potential danger AI could represent, and society's self-destruction. Is the band's first concept album, and is very
                progressive and melodic in its style. The songs are all very mystical in the way they sound. As a concept album, it did 
                not sell really well, although it was praised by the critics.

                Prog Metal <br><br> Latest album from the band. Published 2023 at Warner Records. Placed 13th in Billboard 200 and 21st in 
                OCC. Second concept album of the band, it's themed around absurdism and existentialism. It uses a number of electronic
                effects through all its different songs, and is generally very avant-garde and progressive for metal standards. It has 
                received a pretty unanimous critical acclaim, which can be explained by the fact it's a very niche album.
